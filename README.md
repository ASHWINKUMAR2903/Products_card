## Date:
## Objective:

To replicate a product card layout similar to those found on real-time e-commerce platform like FlipKart using the CSS Box Model (margin, border, padding, and content).

## Tasks:

#### 1. Structure the HTML Layout:
Create a container ```<div>``` for the product card.

Add an ```<img>``` for the product image.

Include ```<h2>``` for product name, ```<p>``` for description, and a ```<span>``` or ```<div>``` for price.

Add a “Buy Now” or “Add to Cart” button.

#### 2. Apply Box Model Styling in CSS:
Use padding inside each section (image, text, button) to ensure readability.

Use margin around the card to space it from the page edges or other cards.

Add a border to outline the card.

Control width and height for consistent sizing.

#### 3. Visual Styling:
Add a background color to the card container.

Use box-shadow to simulate depth (card lifting effect).

Add border-radius for rounded corners.

#### 4. Center the Card:
Use display: flex and justify-content: center and align-items: center on the parent container.

#### 5. Bonus Enhancements:
Use a hover effect on the button (e.g., background color change).

Make the card responsive with percentage-based widths or media queries.
